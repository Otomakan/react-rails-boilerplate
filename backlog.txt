used mongoimport --db seekafrique_development --collection countries --file countries.csv --type csv  --headerline
 to get countries by name

Figured out the general db structure, should be fast from now on. 

Found list of universities, industries, majors

EKPEMI TO DO: List of degree titles, regions, main cities

In education I create two fields for instituion institution, and tempeducation. One is inst_id, the other one allows a string. IN the react this means that the Post will have to be different depending on list choose or not.

Put a userInfo in userprofile

Must think about how to validate presence, and for instituoon must have at least one field validated between string and inst list

to query embedded objects:  User.find_by('userProfile.personalInfo.firstName':'jack')

for the personal info forms pleas check that you have some some server query to tell what has been done, so users don't send the same stuff twice.
